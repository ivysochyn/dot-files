# Dot Files

This is a collection of configuration files for various programs I use.

## Installation
In order to install the dot files, run the following command:
```bash
$ ./setup.sh
```

This will create symlinks to the dot files in the home directory.
**Note:** This will overwrite existing configuration files.

## Programs
The following programs are supported:
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
